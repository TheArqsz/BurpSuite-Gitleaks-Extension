Step 1: Locate the Full Credentials
The scanner identified a potential AWS credential: {{SECRET}}

To verify this, you need the full pair:
1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (starts with AKIA, ASIA, etc.)
2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (approx. 40 random characters)

Step 2: Export Variables
Open your terminal and set the credentials (replace the placeholders):

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={{SECRET}}  # (Or the corresponding ID if this is the secret)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_FOUND_SECRET_KEY

Step 3: Verify Identity
Run the following command to check if the keys are active:

aws sts get-caller-identity

Step 4: Analyze Response
- JSON with "Account" & "Arn": VALID (The keys are active)
- "InvalidClientTokenId": INVALID (The keys do not exist)
- "SignatureDoesNotMatch": INVALID (The ID/Secret pair is incorrect)
